# Facebook Post Fetcher

This project is a simple application that fetches posts from a specific Facebook page and removes any posts that are included in a blocklist of post IDs. The application also includes functionality to add new post IDs to the blocklist.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You will also need to have a Facebook developer account and create a new app to get an API key.

Once you have those dependencies installed, you can clone this repository and run `npm install` in the project directory to install the necessary packages.

## Usage

The main entry point for the application is the `fetch.ts` file. This file exports a `fetchPosts` function that takes two arguments: a `pageId` string and an optional `blocklist` of post IDs.

The function returns an array of `Post` objects, which includes the post's ID, message, link, and any attachments. The attachments include an array of media such as photos or videos.

You can add new post IDs to the blocklist by importing the `addIdToBlocklist` function from the `blocklist.ts` file and passing in the ID of the post you want to add to the blocklist.

## Error Handling

The application is designed to throw specific errors when certain conditions are not met. The `errors.ts` file includes custom error classes for invalid arguments passed to a function, errors thrown by the Facebook API, and errors thrown while reading a file.

## Interfaces

The `interfaces.ts` file includes interfaces for a `Post`, an `Attachment`, `Media`, and a `Blocklist`. These interfaces provide structure and type safety for the data being returned from the application.

## Deployment

This application is ready to be deployed as is, you can use the `fetchPosts` function in your own application or you can use the `addIdToBlocklist` function to add post IDs to the blocklist.
